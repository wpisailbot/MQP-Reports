The WPI Sailbot team initially started in the 2015-2016 school year,
with the intention of competing in the 2016 Sailbot competition with
a minimal boat. For every competition year since then, at least one
MQP (Major Qualifying Project) has been attached to the project.
This README just provides perma-links to the various MQP reports.

The code for all the years should be available in repos as part of the
https://github.com/wpisailbot organization.
